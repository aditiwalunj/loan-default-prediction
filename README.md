# Loan Default Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan will default based on financial data from LendingClub. It uses logistic regression and visualizes model performance across different probability thresholds.

## Project Structure
- `src/main.py`: Main script
- `data/`: Data folder (add CSV manually)
- `plots/`: Graphs generated by the script

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Add the dataset (`accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv`) to `data/`
3. Install packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script: `python src/main.py`

> ⚠️ GitHub doesn't allow CSV files over 100MB — that's why the dataset isn't included.
